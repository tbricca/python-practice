########## NUMBERS & MATH ###############

#division returns float numbers
# NEW MATH OPERATORS

# ** = Exponentiation  raises it to a power
print (2 ** 3) 
# = 8 

# % = Modulo (remainder operator)
# ----- it takes 2 numbers, takes one of them and divides it into it as many times as possible and then gives us the remainder
print (10 % 3) 
# = 1 

# = Integer Division 
# divides and answers it without a float or decimal 
print(10//3)
# = 3

######## VARIABLES ############
# They're like contianers - they store some data and you can pull it out later 
# They hold a value and have a name 
# ex. of things you can store in a variable - numbers, booleans & strings 

### Variables can be resassinged 
# python = 100
# another_var = python 
# python = 1337 
# Assigning multiple variables at once - all, at, once = 5, 10, 15 
# all = 5; at = 10; once = 15

############# DATA TYPES #############
# bool - true or false values 
# int - an integer (1,2,3)
# str - string - a sequenxe of Unicode characters "____" 
# list - an ordered sequence of values of other data types e.g [1,2,3] or ["a","b", "c"]
# dict - a collection of key:vaules, e.g.{"first_name": "Colt", "last_name": "Steele"}
